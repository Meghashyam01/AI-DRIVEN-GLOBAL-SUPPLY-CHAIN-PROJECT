**Relevance to the Article**

The article does not explicitly mention sugar supply chain risks, as it focuses on poppi's collaboration with Target to introduce its first-ever apparel collection and a limited-edition 'Cream Soda' flavor. However, the article does mention that the Cream Soda flavor has only 5 grams of sugar and 30 calories per serving, which suggests that sugar is an ingredient in the product. This implies that poppi, as a food and beverage company, may be vulnerable to sugar supply chain risks, including agricultural, manufacturing, geographic, economic, and political risks.

Overall, the article highlights the importance of considering sugar supply chain risks and implementing mitigation strategies to ensure a resilient and reliable supply chain. By diversifying sourcing regions, investing in modern refining technologies, and using strategic stockpiling and predictive analytics, companies like poppi can reduce the impact of sugar supply chain disruptions on their operations and reputation."
