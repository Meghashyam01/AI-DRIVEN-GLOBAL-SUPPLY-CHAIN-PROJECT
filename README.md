AI-Driven Supply Chain Disruption Predictor and Inventory Optimization System
Project Overview
This project aims to develop an advanced AI-powered system that transforms supply chain management by monitoring global data, predicting disruptions, and dynamically optimizing inventory levels. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA for natural language processing, this system integrates seamlessly with tools such as Google Sheets and ERP systems while providing real-time alerts through Slack or Email. It enables businesses to proactively manage risks, reduce losses, and ensure operational continuity amid global uncertainties.
